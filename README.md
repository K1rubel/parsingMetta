# meTTa_Training -- Parsing Metta atoms in python

### Tasks
1. Querying Single Relationship

2. Querying Multiple Relationships

3. Formating output using parsing

## ðŸ“’
-- *dict_format.py* is just what i was experimenting with. Passed the retun value as a string and parsed the output

the correct version is found in the *main.py* works just fine.



Thanks!
